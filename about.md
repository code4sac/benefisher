Benefisher is an public services search application created by five students from California State University to help serve the community.
Team Wakati, made up of [Jesse], [Adrian], [Anthony], [Daniel], and [James], got together with a vision of making it easier for people to
find the help they need. Sponsored by Code4Sac, a brigade of Code For America, Benefisher aims to be an application that any county can use
to help their people find public services in their area.
