##[Project Charter]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/ProjectCharter.pdf)
The Project Charter describes the project, establishes expectations between stakeholders, and describes processes for managing the project. The Project Charter will serve as a reference on these topics throughout the project.

##[Software Project Management Proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/SPMP.pdf)
The Software Project Management Proposal establishes roles, responsibilities, processes and schedules for managing the software development process, in addition to outlining the tools, methods, and procedures to be used.

##[Software Requirements Specification]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/SRS.pdf)
The purposes of this Software Requirements Specification document are to:
1 Clearly define all user functionality and quality attributes the product must exhibit in order to satisfy the sponsor’s stated need, based on prior requirements elicitation.
2 Create a baseline for the design specification of the product.
3 Solidify and validate the understanding of requirements between the development team and the project sponsor to conclude the requirements engineering phase. 

##[Software Design Specification]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/SDS.pdf)
This Software Design Specification (SDS) exists to establish a baseline for the technical design of Benefisher. This document is primarily a blueprint for Team Wakati to use in implementing the project, but should also provide the project sponsor with insight into Benefisher’s technical design for use in later maintenance of the project.

##[Software Test Specification]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/STS.pdf)
The purpose of the STS is to describe the plan for testing the software, and to specify the test cases and test procedures necessary to demonstrate that the software satisfies the requirements as specified in the project’s System Requirements Specification document.

##[Software Test Report]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/STR.pdf)
The System Test Report summarizes the results of the designated testing activities identified in the System Test Specification document and provides evaluations based on these tests.
